# reimagined-succotash- Blake's Tic Tac Toe
I really enjoyed this project, it was challenging yet rewarding and enabled me to complete my first complete (somewhat) project. You can find it here - https://blakedavis28.github.io/reimagined-succotash/index.html
## Tech Used 
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript 
### My Approach 
My initial approach was to look around the internet and use Chrome Dev Tools to look at existing Tic Tac Toe boards and how they were built.
Once I was confident in how to build the board, I began by completing a simple HTML structure, including a board of cells to make the board. 
I then created a more complex CSS design, utilising CSS variables, particularly before and after, to complete both the styling of my pages, and my X and O markers.
I also used CSS to manipulate the cursor to allow/dissallow hover after the cell in question was selected. 
For the JavaScript, I decided against using jQuery, as the task at hand was relatively simple enough to use the DOM without sacrificing too much extra time.
I created functions to check for Win/Draw against the number of winning combinations, click events and ternary operators were also used. 
### Site Structure
My site includes 3 pages: 
 - Welcome page: built in pure HTML & CSS, including an animation. This page has a navigation bar that links to the following two sections.
 - Info Page (How to Play): Another static page detailing how to play Tic Tac Toe via a youtube video embedded on the page.
 - Play a Friend: A simple gameboard built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows a game to be played, showing whether X or O wins at the end of the game.
 ### Credits
Resources I found helpful during this task were: 
 - Joel Turnbull and Aleks Brymora of General Assembly Sydney (preach)
 - FreeCodeCamp (as always, thanks to Beau Carnes https://twitter.com/beaucarnes)
 - Udemy (Brad Traversy - Modern JavaScript from the beginning)
 - Web Dev Simplified 
 - Kevin Powell (Learn CSS) 
 ### Summary
 In summary, I am pleased with the end result. For a first project I think the design looks great and the functionality is there. 
 In the future, I will add a win/loss counter, and maybe an AI function to play against the computer.
